## Overview 

This session utilizes Tableau to explore the logic behind constructing fundamental visualizations. The primary focus is on temporal dimension analysis: practicing the ability to switch between different time scales (Year/Month/Day) through drill-down functions. By adjusting the granularity of time, we can more accurately identify performance variances across different periods, thereby enhancing our capacity to interpret business trends.
